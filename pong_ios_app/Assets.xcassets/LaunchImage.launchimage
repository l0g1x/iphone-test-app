The file "pong_ios_app/Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.launchimage" is not a code file, but a directory that contains image files used for the launch screen of the app. The actual images are not generated by code, but are added manually. The directory structure and the Contents.json file, which describes the images, would look something like this:

Contents.json:

{
  "images" : [
    {
      "idiom" : "iphone",
      "filename" : "LaunchImage.png",
      "extent" : "full-screen",
      "minimum-system-version" : "7.0",
      "orientation" : "portrait",
      "scale" : "2x"
    },
    {
      "idiom" : "iphone",
      "filename" : "LaunchImage@2x.png",
      "extent" : "full-screen",
      "minimum-system-version" : "7.0",
      "orientation" : "portrait",
      "scale" : "3x"
    }
  ],
  "info" : {
    "version" : 1,
    "author" : "xcode"
  }
}

Please note that the actual images "LaunchImage.png" and "LaunchImage@2x.png" should be added to the "pong_ios_app/Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.launchimage" directory manually. These images should be designed to match the look and feel of the app, and to fit the screen sizes of the target devices.
