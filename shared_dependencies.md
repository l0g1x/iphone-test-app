1. UIKit: All the Swift files will import UIKit, which provides the core tools for building iOS interfaces.

2. Game: The "Game.swift" file will contain the main game logic, which will be used by "ViewController.swift" to control the game flow.

3. Paddle and Ball: The "Paddle.swift" and "Ball.swift" files will define the Paddle and Ball classes, which will be used in "Game.swift" and "View.swift" for game mechanics and rendering.

4. AI: The "AI.swift" file will define the AI class, which will be used in "Game.swift" to control the computer's paddle.

5. ViewController: The "ViewController.swift" file will be used in "AppDelegate.swift" and "SceneDelegate.swift" to set up the initial view controller.

6. View: The "View.swift" file will be used in "ViewController.swift" to handle the game's visual elements.

7. AppDelegate and SceneDelegate: These files will share the application lifecycle events and will be used in "main.swift" to launch the application.

8. Assets: The "Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset" and "Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.launchimage" will be used in "Info.plist", "AppDelegate.swift", and "SceneDelegate.swift" to set up the app's icon and launch image.

9. Main.storyboard and LaunchScreen.storyboard: These files will be used in "AppDelegate.swift" and "SceneDelegate.swift" to set up the main interface and the launch screen.

10. Info.plist: This file will be used in "AppDelegate.swift" and "SceneDelegate.swift" to configure the app's settings.

11. Function Names: Functions like "startGame()", "updateGame()", "endGame()" in "Game.swift" will be used in "ViewController.swift" to control the game flow. Functions like "movePaddle()" in "Paddle.swift" and "moveBall()" in "Ball.swift" will be used in "Game.swift" to update the game state.

12. Variable Names: Variables like "playerPaddle", "computerPaddle", "ball" in "Game.swift" will be shared with "ViewController.swift", "View.swift", "Paddle.swift", "Ball.swift", and "AI.swift".
